      interpret it as an URI. The expectation is that the URI dereferences to a response with
      Content-type `application/json` where the data is a VC or an `array` of VCs.</li><li>If
      the value is a JSON `object` interpret it as a VC according to the [Verifiable Credentials
      JSON Schema](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-json-schemas/).</li><li>If the value is an
      `array` and an item in the `array` is a JSON `object` interpret it as a VC.</li><li>If
      the value is an `array` and an items is a `string` interpret the item as an URI that
      dereferences to VC(s)</li><li>Credentials should only be taken into account if the [`credentialSubject`](https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/#property-definitions)
      matches with the declarer (e.g. [`did:pkh`](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-pkh/blob/main/did-pkh-method-draft.md)

    x-iscc-schema-doc: A credential is a set of one or more claims made by an issuer. A verifiable
      credential is a tamper-evident credential that has authorship that can be cryptographically
      verified. Verifiable credentials can be used to build verifiable presentations, which
      can also be cryptographically verified. The claims in a credential can be about different
      subjects.
  verifications:
    description: A list of self-verifications. Self-verifications are public URLs under the

      with text that contains a multihash of the ISCC declaration signees wallet address in
      the format of `verify:<multihash-of-wallet-address>:verify`.
